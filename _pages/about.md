I am an upcoming Ph.D. student at Stanford ICME (Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering). I did my undergraduate at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Applied and Computational Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science. 
Broadly speaking, my research interests are in the modeling of stochastic processes in real-world applications and 
building provably efficient algorithms for the optimization of such models. I especially enjoy problems at the intersection of continuous optimization, statistics, and machine learning. 
At Caltech, I have done research in the fields of convex/smooth optimization and rare event simulation with some awesome collaborators.
