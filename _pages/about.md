I am a an upcoming PhD student at Stanford ICME (Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering). I did my undergraduate at the California Insitiute of Technology (Caltech) studying Applied and Computational Mathematics 
with a minor in Computer Science. Broadly speaking, my research interest are in the modeling of stochastic processes in real world and engineering applications and building efficient computational algorithms for the optimization and 
uncertainty quantification of such models. At Caltech, I have been able to do research in the field of convex optimization and rare event simulation with some awesome people.
